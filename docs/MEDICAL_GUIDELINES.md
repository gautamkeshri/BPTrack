# Medical Guidelines - Blood Pressure Monitoring Application

## Clinical Standards Compliance

### ACC/AHA 2017 Blood Pressure Guidelines
This application implements the latest American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) 2017 guidelines for blood pressure classification and management.

## Blood Pressure Classification

### Standard Categories

#### Normal Blood Pressure
- **Systolic**: Less than 120 mmHg
- **Diastolic**: Less than 80 mmHg
- **Criteria**: Both systolic AND diastolic in normal range
- **Color Code**: Green (#16A34A)
- **Recommendation**: Maintain healthy lifestyle

#### Elevated Blood Pressure
- **Systolic**: 120-129 mmHg
- **Diastolic**: Less than 80 mmHg
- **Criteria**: Systolic elevated but diastolic normal
- **Color Code**: Yellow (#EAB308)
- **Recommendation**: Lifestyle modifications, monitor regularly

#### Hypertension Stage 1
- **Systolic**: 130-139 mmHg OR
- **Diastolic**: 80-89 mmHg
- **Criteria**: Either systolic OR diastolic in Stage 1 range
- **Color Code**: Orange (#F97316)
- **Recommendation**: Lifestyle changes, consider medication

#### Hypertension Stage 2
- **Systolic**: 140 mmHg or higher OR
- **Diastolic**: 90 mmHg or higher
- **Criteria**: Either systolic OR diastolic in Stage 2 range
- **Color Code**: Red (#DC2626)
- **Recommendation**: Lifestyle changes AND medication

#### Hypertensive Crisis
- **Systolic**: Higher than 180 mmHg OR
- **Diastolic**: Higher than 120 mmHg
- **Criteria**: Either systolic OR diastolic in crisis range
- **Color Code**: Dark Red (#B91C1C)
- **Recommendation**: Immediate medical attention required

## Measurement Standards

### Blood Pressure Measurement
- **Units**: mmHg (millimeters of mercury)
- **Systolic Range**: 70-250 mmHg (application validates)
- **Diastolic Range**: 40-150 mmHg (application validates)
- **Notation**: Always displayed as "Systolic/Diastolic"

### Pulse Rate Measurement
- **Units**: BPM (beats per minute)
- **Normal Range**: 60-100 BPM (adults at rest)
- **Application Range**: 40-200 BPM (validates extreme values)
- **Clinical Significance**: Used for cardiovascular assessment

## Calculated Clinical Metrics

### Pulse Pressure (PP)
```
Formula: PP = Systolic - Diastolic
Normal Range: 30-50 mmHg
```

**Clinical Significance:**
- Indicator of arterial stiffness
- Higher values may indicate cardiovascular risk
- Lower values may suggest heart problems

**Interpretation:**
- **< 30 mmHg**: May indicate heart failure or shock
- **30-50 mmHg**: Normal range
- **> 60 mmHg**: May indicate arterial stiffness

### Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)
```
Formula: MAP = Diastolic + (Pulse Pressure / 3)
Normal Range: 70-100 mmHg
```

**Clinical Significance:**
- Represents average pressure during cardiac cycle
- Important for organ perfusion assessment
- More stable than systolic/diastolic alone

**Interpretation:**
- **< 65 mmHg**: May indicate inadequate organ perfusion
- **65-100 mmHg**: Normal range
- **> 100 mmHg**: May indicate hypertension

## Clinical Documentation Standards

### Data Accuracy Requirements
- **Timestamp Precision**: Record exact date and time of measurement
- **Measurement Conditions**: Note if patient was sitting, standing, or lying down
- **Arm Used**: Document which arm was used for measurement
- **Multiple Readings**: Average of 2-3 readings when possible

### Medical History Integration
- **Pre-existing Conditions**: Track diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease
- **Medications**: Note blood pressure medications
- **Family History**: Document cardiovascular family history
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Record smoking, exercise, diet habits

## Report Generation Standards

## Data Validation & Quality

### Input Validation
```typescript
// Physiologically reasonable ranges
systolic: 70-250 mmHg    // Covers extreme medical conditions
diastolic: 40-150 mmHg   // Covers shock to severe hypertension
pulse: 40-200 BPM        // Covers bradycardia to extreme tachycardia
```

### Data Quality Checks
- Validate systolic > diastolic (basic physiological requirement)
- Flag unusual readings for review
- Ensure temporal consistency in measurements
- Detect potential measurement errors

## Privacy & Security Compliance

### HIPAA Considerations
While this is a personal health application, it follows HIPAA-aligned practices:

- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary health information
- **Access Control**: Profile-based data isolation
- **Audit Trail**: Track data access and modifications
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies
- **Export Control**: Secure report generation

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **Session Security**: Secure session management
- **Input Sanitization**: Prevent data injection
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive data in error messages

## Clinical Use Guidelines

### Recommended Measurement Practices
1. **Consistent Timing**: Measure at same time daily
2. **Proper Position**: Sitting with feet flat, arm at heart level
3. **Rest Period**: 5 minutes of rest before measurement
4. **Multiple Readings**: Take 2-3 readings, 1 minute apart
5. **Record Immediately**: Enter data promptly after measurement

### Frequency Recommendations
- **Normal BP**: Annual screening
- **Elevated BP**: Every 3-6 months
